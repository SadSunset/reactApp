# reactApp
It is test project for learning famous framework React, for understanding Git.
I decided to make this to understand projects creation on the React using the extensive capabilities of git such as creating branch, some methods of commit and so on.
As for me it will improve my hard skills as Frontend-developer. I hope I will succeed and I will not give up this case. Good luck me!
